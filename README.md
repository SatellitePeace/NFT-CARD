# Frontend Mentor - NFT preview card component

The challenge was to build an already designed order summary card component from scratch and get it to look as close to the original design as possible

## Tools I Used

I used

1.  Semantic HTML5
2.  CSS grid, flexbox and other css properties to structure and style this NFT preview card.

## What I Learned

I learnt how to use increase and decrease the size of an svg image using css transform:scale(); property

I also learnt a new way of using the SPAN element in both HTML5 and CSS3
